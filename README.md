# Hackpack Mods
These are my mods to the Crunchlabs Hackpack build boxes. If you download them and anything bad every happens in your life, it's not my fault.

### Installation
Unless otherwise noted, these are Arudino sketches. You'll need to use the Arduino IDE 2.3+ and run the .ino files from a folder with the same name.

The Hack Packs use an Arduino Nano clone, so set that as the board type in the IDE.

You'll need the following libraries added:
- IRremote by shirriff, z3t0, ArminJo
- Adafruit LIS3DH
- Adafruit Unified Sensor
- Adafruit BusIO
